Things to do next:

-Added db functionalities for listing and
    deleting tasks from the client side.
    Currently using the wrong HTTP method
    for deleting, gotta that + the HTML
    href for the delete button.

-Authentication. Login and register 
    functionalities with JWT

-Update the html. Currently working with very
    basic HTML, so I gotta add styling and
    maybe JS to improve functionality.
