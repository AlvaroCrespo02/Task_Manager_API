Things to do next:

-Missing DB actions:
    Full CRUD achieved for API, Client still
    missing Delete and Update


-Authentication. Login and register 
    functionalities with JWT.

-Update the html. Currently working with very
    basic HTML, so I gotta add styling and
    maybe JS to improve functionality.

-Cleanup code:
    Delete useless comments and add new ones
