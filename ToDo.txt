Things to do next:

-Remake the db functionalities. Remade the whole
    database. Gotta check that all the endpoints 
    work properly.


-Authentication. Login and register 
    functionalities with JWT.

-Update the html. Currently working with very
    basic HTML, so I gotta add styling and
    maybe JS to improve functionality.
