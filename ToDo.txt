Things to do next:
-schemas.py ended up being a file to test stuff. 
    I gotta move the endpoints back to main and 
    add the actual schema in schema.py

-Currently working with mock data. Gotta add db
    functionalities.

-Authentication. Login and register 
    functionalities with JWT

-Update the html. Currently working with very
    basic HTML, so I gotta add styling.
